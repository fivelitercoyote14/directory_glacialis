Where is the DB stored
this is a tough one 
for testing the database will be local only but updated via git if that is possible
if not then thats fine, I can put a database in a shared file server or host it on a 
pc i use if needed later on. 

expicit stause for users 
if they no longer work at the organization, then they will be inactive, no need to state reason or date they left
