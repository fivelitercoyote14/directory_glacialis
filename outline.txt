School IT technology Tracker 

 

Goal:  

Cli tool of a schools computer inventory and user data 

Select a school,  

Menu will show a selection of data collections 

Data collections include: 

List of computers and users  

Device and user reports  

Search (search for computer names, user names or other strings)  

 

Actually  

 

Lets just do a massive directory, we already have Active Directory, but it sucks  

 

Let’s make a python cli tool which will act as a directory for my organization.  

It’s not going to be fully up to date, why? Because our Active Directory users are based on imports from our HR system. Our HR system is a SaaS which holds the “foundational” employee database, anyone who gets hired paid and fired (when they are fired they disappear) 

HR manages the inputs and outputs of this data, our system administrators then regularly script or manually import that data into our Active Directory system.  

I cannot access that data and do not want to  

This is what I have and can do 

I have a csv of an export from the HR database, it had a name of very employee, position and possibly location. However that data, despite being only a couple months old, is likely very outdated. I have access to Active Directory and could, if needed, export a csv of all users.. 

I want this python app to have its own database, that simply imported the data mentioned previously, and will need to be manually updated if needed.  

 

The app will need: 

An database of users  

Code that will allow the user to : 

Open the program  

Select different functions such as search, edit and view by school, position etc  

All from command line interface  

 

User workflow should look like this: 

User open program via command line, such as running the “python main.py” command to “open” the program. From the the program should say “Welcome to SCS python directory (alpha project)  

User will be presented with these menu items:  

Search for user 
view list of all users 
view list of users by school
view list of users by position
add directory listing 
remove directory listing 
exit 

psudo code will be a seperate file
