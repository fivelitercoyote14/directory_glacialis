Lets just do a massive directory, we already have Active Directory, but it sucks  

further considerations:
Store last_imported_at for sure and maybe per-record last_verified_at if decided to add later

Decide: manual edits override imports or imports overwrite edits? manual edits override import

Decide: do you keep “terminated” users as inactive (recommended for audit/history) or delete them?
keep them as inactive then delete after a while maybe add an option to do that 

other user permissions:
read only for anyone else who decides they want to use this 
I will be the admin for edits and changes but no one else will really use this
edit justification will be a comment required
