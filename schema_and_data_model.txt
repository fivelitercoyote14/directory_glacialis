a user at minimum is:

source_ID | name of user | first.last | location | position | status | 

source data may have more info but the app needs to be built around the above schema 

considerations:
Unique identifier strategy (critical)

AD: sAMAccountName, userPrincipalName, employeeID (if present), GUID, etc.
- I guess we will find out when we get the data to fill up the database 

HR export: likely has an employee ID. 
-might be used for Unique identifier

Your DB needs a stable key even if names change.

Fields you’ll store

Required vs optional fields (name, preferred name, job title, school, department, phone, email, room, manager, etc.)
- required schema is above
Normalization

Schools should be a controlled list (avoid “Hendersonville HS”, “HHS”, “Hville High” chaos).
- all will be abbreviation of location 
Job titles also need normalization or at least alias mapping.

added consideration (mentioned in outline)
Store last_imported_at and maybe per-record last_verified_at.
