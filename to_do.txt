TO-DO considerations:

Define search modes:

By name (partial, case-insensitive)

By email/username

By school

By position/job family

By phone/extension

Fuzzy matching vs exact matching (be careful; fuzzy can return wrong people)

And define output formatting:

Minimal output (name, school, title) vs detailed view.
